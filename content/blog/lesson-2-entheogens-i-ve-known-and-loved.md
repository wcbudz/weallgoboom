Hello citizen,

As a psychonaut, you'll be experimenting with altered states of consciousness in the interest of self-exploration and knowledge. To achieve those states a variety of methods are available, not all drug-induced.

A pioneer of psychonautica, Stanislov Graf, developed a method of working with just your breath and music called [holtropic breathwork](http://www.holotropic.com/holotropic-breathwork/about-holotropic-breathwork/), which allows us to enter deep states of non-ordinary consciousness.

This is one of but many methods of exploration, but personally, the preferred rocket fuel for propulsion towards the stars of our minds is plant-based entheogens. Entheogen, meaning a drug that facilitates seeing the "god within" is a word coined in the late 70s by a group of ethnobotanists and literary scholars, including R. Gordon Wasson, a man largely responsible for introducing America to psilocybin mushrooms in the late 50s.

Humans have been using entheogens for[ thousands of years in ceremony and religious practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogenic_drugs_and_the_archaeological_record). Today, because of loosening restrictions on these substances are being seen as valuable to the medical industry for healing and wellness. My hope is that we find a path to incorporating them into our culture without allowing capitalism to[ completely knock the teeth out ](https://weallgoboom.com/numinus-pitch-deck/)of these powerful teachers.

You can easily find [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_substances_used_in_rituals) of which plants contain entheogens and have been used by humans. One of the best places to start your research is in the incomparable catalog of human experience with psychoactive substances, [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/psychoactives.shtml).

Erowid is like having the notes of a world-wide team of research psychonauts at your fingertips. You'll find precise reports of how substances were obtained, what dosages were taken, hour by hour trip reports and detailed instructions on cultivating your own supply, from instructions for the advanced chemist to the hobbyist gardener.

If you're an initiate to the psychonaut calling, it can be intimidating to sit in front of this wealth of information and know where to start. My recommendation is to start wherever you are - let the Dao of the psychonaut float you towards what will work given your geolocation, resources and environmental variables.

Cannabis is an overlooked portal to the unexplored; common usage will have you stoned on a couch, passively watching someone else's story on Netflix and over-eating processed foods. But the psychonaut can ascend the mediocre and [glimpse the face of the infinite ](https://bodhitree.com/the-mystical-roots-of-cannabis/)using cannabis as a guide. Cannabis can be easy to procure in most cities and is increasingly legal or decriminalized throughout North America.

But, to truly storm the gates, there is a better option. Slightly less accessible for some, but worth the investment in obtaining a safe and reliable source if possible: psilocybe containing mushrooms.

This entire guide could focus solely on the mushroom, but there are so many expert references out there, I'll make it my role to recommend where to start.

If you don't have a supplier the choice can be made to grow your own. It's much simpler and less resource-intensive than growing cannabis, and growing a lifetime personal supply becomes absolutely simple once you have the fundamentals down.

There are many books and internet discussion on the various methods - we've been cultivating psilocybe at home since the late 1950s - the best place to start IMHO is discussions on [the Shroomery](https://www.shroomery.org/) Create an account there and start engaging with the community or just consuming the knowledge. You'll find a very engaged and welcoming populous - the sense of exploration and scientific investigation of the best methods and hacks to cultivating various species of mushrooms is stupendous.

My favorite method is a piece of tek (shorthand for 'technique') called monotub, developed by many, but in particular the efforts of user[ Mush Zombie](https://www.shroomology.org/forums/topic/46-how-to-grow-shrooms-in-bulk-monotubs/).

Although the fruiting bodies (the part that you recognize as a mushroom) are illegal, in most states in the US the mushroom spores are legal to possess and sell (sorry ID, CA and GA - the spores are also illegal in your state). There is an abundance of spore retailers online, but today my most trusted source is [Sporeworks.](http://sporeworks.com/) We may write a step by step guide from spore procurement to advanced techniques for developing your own liquid cultures in the future - please write in and let us know if this is something you'd be interested in. The final entheogen I'll mention, but more difficult than others to procure is DMT. N,N-Dimethyltryptamine is a naturally occurring chemical. It's in our own brains, it's in many plants, and some animals even produce it in their secretions. Smoking DMT can send you into a non-reality that rips the illusion of our day to day world away in a brilliant and terrifying fashion. It has been called the businessman's trip because of how short-acting it is, one could conceivably explore a new dimension listening to the chattering of machine-elves, and be completely grounded back in this reality in the time it takes for a short lunch break.

To use DMT properly you'll need a good psychonatical partner and we recommend some experience with psilocybin before jumping to this advanced technique. We'll also be writing an in-depth guide to this "spirit molecule" in the future.

In the next edition of this guide, we'll go through what is important to know in regards to the set and setting in the use of entheogens and even some retreats that have been established for safe exploration with knowledgeable guides.

Until next time, stay kind.
