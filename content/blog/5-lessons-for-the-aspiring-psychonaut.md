### **Lesson 1: The Dao of the Psychonaut**

**_TL;DR for Lesson 1: Use alternative states of consciousness to start becoming aware of the patterns and streams that make up the mask of "you."_**

What do you feel, when you say the word I; I, myself? You might not think about it in normal conversation.

But when you dig into the chambers of your experience and try to surface it, you see it’s elusive at best.

Alan Watts said, “That’s why there’s always an element of profound mystery in the problem of who we are. Because what you are in your inmost being escapes your own examination in exactly the same way in that you can’t look into your own eyes without using a mirror, you can’t bite your own teeth, you can’t taste your own tongue and you can’t touch the tip of this finger with the tip of this finger.”

This is the problem the psychonaut tackles. A psychonaut is someone who is relentlessly focused on the search for a signal in the noise to show us who we really are.

The word psychonaut is from the Ancient Greek words psychē “soul, spirit, mind” and ναύτηςnaútēs “sailor, navigator” – “a sailor of the soul” and this is what we do - using tools of mind exploration we enter altered states that allow us to put a new lens on our minds and explore unknown landscapes.

Like Jim Carrey said, at some point in the psychonaut’s life they say, “I don’t care what it looks like, I found a hole in the psyche and I’m going through and I’m going to face the abyss of not knowing whether that’s going to be ok with everybody or not.”

There is no rulebook for how this exploration commences, no psychenomicon to catalog the monsters you may encounter in the abyss as these things are all unique to your particular combination of experiences and chemical makeup. What we hope to do in this guide is to give you an introduction to some of the lessons our experience has shown us to be useful heuristics for navigating the sea of the mind.

What we’ll talk about in this first installment is what we’ll call the Dao of the psychonaut.

In Daoism, we can think of Dao loosely translated as way or path, or most simply as Lao-tzu put it, “The Dao principle is what happens of itself.”

As psychonauts, we think of the Dao as the course, the flow, or the process of nature. It’s a “stateless state” that the psychonaut tries to direct their awareness to in their explorations. Being with the Dao is what lets us glimpse our true nature.

Verbal descriptions lose what we’re getting at here - the Dao cannot be defined in words, and it’s not really an idea that you can put in a box.

You can’t put the wind in a sack.

So what good does the Dao do us in our psychoanutical quests?

The principle is that if everything is allowed to go its own way the harmony of the universe will be established since every process in the world can “do its own thing” only in relation to all others.

In your explorations of your own consciousness, you’re going to work on letting go of the ego, our instrument for imposing its own sense of order on the world and ourselves and touch the place where you understand that everything’s own way is the way of the universe.

When you can do this you’ll have a glimpse of “who you are” and as Ram Dass said, “only when I know who I am, will I know what is possible.”

The difficulty in getting to that place where you can bear witness to the flow of things is that you have layers upon layers of psychological constructions in the way. Constructions that might keep you ‘safe’ as many of our apparatuses formed as defenses to a hostile, confusing or otherwise traumatic event in our childhood, but they block us from letting go and experiencing the stream of nature that carries us behind our machinations.

There are also constructions of our culture - in some way these keep these safe in a collective as well, but mostly, and Terence McKenna is a fantastic resource for this line of thinking, culture is a perversion of nature that drives us to false happiness and dehumanization and isolation from the Dao.

This is not easy work.

But what you’ll come to know with effort on the psychonaut’s path is that there are no good trips, there are no bad trips, that there are just trips. Putting that at the forefront when embarking on a journey is the first step towards keeping your vessel sailing towards the Dao.

### **Lesson 2: Entheogens I've known and loved**

**_TL;DR for lesson 2: Any kind of altered state can be a doorway to self-exploration. Choose something that is safely procured, develop your path with that method, and branch out from there._**

Hello citizen, As a psychonaut, you'll be experimenting with altered states of consciousness in the interest of self-exploration and knowledge. To achieve those states a variety of methods are available, not all drug-induced. A pioneer of psychonautica, Stanislov Graf, developed a method of working with just your breath and music called [holtropic breathwork](http://www.holotropic.com/holotropic-breathwork/about-holotropic-breathwork/), which allows us to enter deep states of non-ordinary consciousness. This is one of but many methods of exploration, but personally, the preferred rocket fuel for propulsion towards the stars of our minds is plant-based entheogens. Entheogen, meaning a drug that facilitates seeing the "god within" is a word coined in the late 70s by a group of ethnobotanists and literary scholars, including R. Gordon Wasson, a man largely responsible for introducing America to psilocybin mushrooms in the late 50s.

![](/content/assets/lifecover.jpg)

Humans have been using entheogens for[ thousands of years in ceremony and religious practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogenic_drugs_and_the_archaeological_record). Today, because of loosening restrictions on these substances are being seen as valuable to the medical industry for healing and wellness. My hope is that we find a path to incorporating them into our culture without allowing capitalism to[ completely knock the teeth out ](https://weallgoboom.com/numinus-pitch-deck/)of these powerful teachers.

You can easily find [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_substances_used_in_rituals) of which plants contain entheogens and have been used by humans. One of the best places to start your research is in the incomparable catalog of human experience with psychoactive substances, [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/psychoactives.shtml).

Erowid is like having the notes of a world-wide team of research psychonauts at your fingertips. You'll find precise reports of how substances were obtained, what dosages were taken, hour by hour trip reports and detailed instructions on cultivating your own supply, from instructions for the advanced chemist to the hobbyist gardener.

If you're an initiate to the psychonaut calling, it can be intimidating to sit in front of this wealth of information and know where to start. My recommendation is to start wherever you are - let the Dao of the psychonaut float you towards what will work given your geolocation, resources and environmental variables.

Cannabis is an overlooked portal to the unexplored; common usage will have you stoned on a couch, passively watching someone else's story on Netflix and over-eating processed foods. But the psychonaut can ascend the mediocre and [glimpse the face of the infinite ](https://bodhitree.com/the-mystical-roots-of-cannabis/)using cannabis as a guide. Cannabis can be easy to procure in most cities and is increasingly legal or decriminalized throughout North America.

But, to truly storm the gates, there is a better option. Slightly less accessible for some, but worth the investment in obtaining a safe and reliable source if possible: psilocybe containing mushrooms.

This entire guide could focus solely on the mushroom, but there are so many expert references out there, I'll make it my role to recommend where to start.

If you don't have a supplier the choice can be made to grow your own. It's much simpler and less resource-intensive than growing cannabis, and growing a lifetime personal supply becomes absolutely simple once you have the fundamentals down.

There are many books and internet discussion on the various methods - we've been cultivating psilocybe at home since the late 1950s - the best place to start IMHO is discussions on [the Shroomery](https://www.shroomery.org/) Create an account there and start engaging with the community or just consuming the knowledge. You'll find a very engaged and welcoming populous - the sense of exploration and scientific investigation of the best methods and hacks to cultivating various species of mushrooms is stupendous.

My favorite method is a piece of tek (shorthand for 'technique') called monotub, developed by many, but in particular the efforts of user[ Mush Zombie](https://www.shroomology.org/forums/topic/46-how-to-grow-shrooms-in-bulk-monotubs/).

Although the fruiting bodies (the part that you recognize as a mushroom) are illegal, in most states in the US the mushroom spores are legal to possess and sell (sorry ID, CA and GA - the spores are also illegal in your state). There is an abundance of spore retailers online, but today my most trusted source is [Sporeworks.](http://sporeworks.com/) We may write a step by step guide from spore procurement to advanced techniques for developing your own liquid cultures in the future - please write in and let us know if this is something you'd be interested in. The final entheogen I'll mention, but more difficult than others to procure is DMT. N,N-Dimethyltryptamine is a naturally occurring chemical. It's in our own brains, it's in many plants, and some animals even produce it in their secretions. Smoking DMT can send you into a non-reality that rips the illusion of our day to day world away in a brilliant and terrifying fashion. It has been called the businessman's trip because of how short-acting it is, one could conceivably explore a new dimension listening to the chattering of machine-elves, and be completely grounded back in this reality in the time it takes for a short lunch break.

To use DMT properly you'll need a good psychonatical partner and we recommend some experience with psilocybin before jumping to this advanced technique. We'll also be writing an in-depth guide to this "spirit molecule" in the future.

In the next edition of this guide, we'll go through what is important to know in regards to the set and setting in the use of entheogens and even some retreats that have been established for safe exploration with knowledgeable guides.

### **Lesson 3: Set and setting, the inner mind and outer world**

**_TL;DR for lesson 3: Your mental and physical environment preceding a trip will shape the experience. Do prework to get yourself in a state where you can accept and mindfully observe what transpires vs being swept up in and reacting to it._**

Maybe more important than any detail of the psychonaut's experience is developing a proper set and setting for your explorations.

Set is shorthand for mindset, the setting is the physical environment that you're situated in, so we're talking about your inner and outer landscape.

For a proper setting, you want to design your environment in a way that will support your altered state. Think about things that might be difficult while on your journey, like figuring out what music to play or getting up to get water, etc. Here's a quick list of things you could do to help the setting:

* Get playlists but together by mood, so you can quickly change to a feeling vs searching for a certain song
* Try to create at least a couple playlists that are free of lyrics since words can be distracting during come-up and peak experience
* Prepare a plate of cut fruit for the comedown period
* Have bottles of water placed throughout your space
* Make the space tidy and free of obstructions - a messy space can negatively impact your mindset during a trip
* If you decide on an outdoor space, have a blanket to lie down on and a sweater or something to keep yourself cozy
* In an indoor space, avoid candles or other flames that you have to maintain, but think through different lighting options like dimmers, or fairy lights
* If possible, invite a sitter who will not be on the trip, but has experience themselves and will assist with keeping the setting optimized and each trippers set calm

Your mindset or 'set' is, in my opinion, the most important area to cultivate for a psychonaut. Do you have a meditation practice? How do you deal with stress and anxiety in your everyday life? Is this a time in your life where you feel prepared to face stark realities of your existence, your past and possible future?

While entheogens can certainly help cultivate a flexible mind that can deal well with all that a psychedelic voyage brings, going into the trip flippantly is likely to have harsh consequences.

The best strategy is to do work leading up to your experience that helps you remain mindful and within the Dao of the psychonaut.

Here's our prep list for cultivating a proper set:

* Practice meditation for waking mindfulness. These two apps are a great place to get started if you don't have a practice: [headspace ](https://www.headspace.com/)or [10% happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/)
* Write down an intention for your trip. What are you trying to learn, or understand? What are you open to?
* Have conversations with each person who will be tripping with you beforehand and discuss what you're each looking to get out of the experience
* Establish boundaries with each tripper, e.g. let each other know, do you want to be held if you cry? Are back rubs or other touching permitted? What should people know about your previous experiences if any and how you like to interact with others during a trip.
* Do breathwork so that your ability to 'ground' yourself is heightened. Practice easy controlled breaths in on a count of 4, easily controlled breaths out on a count of four - feel the ground under your feet

And maybe most importantly for the set, remember what Timothy Leary said (and the Beatles quoted in Tomorrow Never Knows"), "**_Whenever in doubt_**, **_turn off your mind_**, **_relax_**, **_float downstream_**.'

Relax and let the teachers show you what you need to see. Both sets and settings can be supported by going on a psychedelic retreat with a reputable and experienced organization. If you are less experienced with entheogens and have the financial means, this can be a good way to start exploring.

### **Lesson 4: Ordeals in the hero's journey aka how to stop a bad trip**

**_TL;DR for lesson 4: A trip is likened to the hero's journey. It's not going to always be easy, but through the 'bad' times we have our biggest opportunities for the transformation we're searching for._**

In Joseph Campbell's [The Hero with a Thousand Faces](https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936), he outlines the hero's journey, which is a framework in literature, myth, and stories that is a powerful archetype of the hero's voyage towards self-discovery, transformation, and growth. There are 12 steps to the hero's journey, broken into 3 acts:

Act 1: Departure

Act 2: Initiation

Act 3: Return

Overlaying this framework on your own path can be a powerful mechanism for coping with what might otherwise be experienced as a 'bad' trip.

I don't put quotes around 'bad' to make light of the psychological depths and demons we face - qualifying a trip a bad can certainly be valid when we're feeling locked in loops, trapped in self-judgment, or enveloped in fear during a psychedelic experience.

For the advanced psychonaut though, 'bad' does become a less meaningful modifier because with intention and practice you can start to see the ordeals that you might come across during your journey as the biggest opportunities for transformation and insight - and that's why we're here, right?

In the **departure**, the hero is in the 'ordinary world' and something happens or information is received that piques their interests or acts as a call to adventure (following the white rabbit). The hero may refuse the call and believe that this isn't a journey they can undertake, or they're not the right person. A mentor comes in and leads the hero across a boundary, escorting them into a new, _unknown world.

_The unknown world is where the **initiation** begins. The hero faces trials, either alone or with the assistance of their traveling party.

The hero eventually reaches the main crises where they face "the ordeal." This is the key to our 'bad' trip experience. In the ordeal of a trip, just like Campbell's hero's journey, you'll face pursuit by guardians of the unknown world, or you may be entranced into wanting to never leave the special place. If you've done the pre-work, set your intentions, surrounded yourself with travelers that you trust and everyone knows their part, you'll conquer the ordeal and start your return to the ordinary world in the **return** - the most important act of the journey as this is where you'll bring back the elixir or the knowledge and transformation that can help your community and beyond.

Now, this mythological framework may be a powerful lens for seeing your life and psychonaut's journey, but what about when the shit gets really _really_ bad during a trip? If you need a lifeline, there are few ways to pull the ripcord.

1\. Have a piece of paper with a message in your pocket - "you've taken a substance, this is a trip, it will pass" - that phrase, repeated in your head can act as a powerful reassurance that grounds you.

2\. Speaking of grounding - use your breath-work, 4 slow counts in, 4 slow counts out, feel your feet on the floor - repeat the above phrase.

3\. Ask for assistance - if you have trip sitter on hand, let them know that you're having a hard time. Connecting with someone who you trust and supports you can ease the difficulty of the experience

4\. Go to a calm, comfortable, quiet space

5\. Do not take other substances - Alcohol, benzodizapiens, cannabis - these can all have the opposite effect you're looking for.

Remember, this is going to pass - if it's LSD or psilocybin, no one has ever died directly from these substances and you couldn't physically take enough for that to happen. It will pass. When you come out on the other side, it's time for integration work. You'll want to examine the fear you experienced, talk this out with a psychedelic therapist if possible, but at the very least journal your journey to help process it and bring that elixir back to others.

### **Lesson 5: Integration aka doing the BIG work**

**TL;DR for lesson 5: In the hero's journey, the final act is 'the return.' This is the most important step where the hero returns to their community with 'the elixir' or learnings from the journey. As a psychonaut, spending focused time on integrating the experience so the teaching is lasting and can be communicated to your community is the name of the game.**

In lesson 4 we talked about the hero's journey; the three acts being:

* Departure
* Initiation
* Return

Briefly, you start in the ordinary world, there is a call to adventure, you pass into the special world, go through an ordeal, obtain the elixir, return to the ordinary world and share the elixir with the community.

Pretty similar to the psychonaut's path with entheogens wouldn't you say?

But without intention, most will forgo what is the most important part of that journey, the integration work required to bring back the elixir.

So what is integration and how do we do it?

Integration is the process that you undertake to translate the experiences you have during a trip into a lasting change in your life, and knowledge that can be articulated to your community.

Integration is also part of the psychonaut’s mindset, which is why when you have deeper levels of experience as a psychonaut, there cease to be any ‘bad’ trips. The experiences can still be an ordeal, there can and will be horrors to face, but you come through the journey and use the experiences whatever they are as grist for the mill of transformation and integrate the way that you’ve been transformed by the experiences in a way that optimizes for lasting change.

A trip should be thought of as a minimum three-day process, similar to the three acts of the hero’s journey.

Day 1: Preparation - This is where you set your intentions, plan your space, playlists, discuss with other travelers your goals and boundaries, etc..

Day 2: The Trip - You start your journey, go through your ordeals, and have your experience

Day 3: Integration - You’ve returned from the trip and now you have a day where you are contemplative, journal, meditate, try to articulate what you’ve experienced, and prepare to come back into a normal day to day life.

The integration work, unfortunately, is not as simple as writing down all the things you’ve seen and thought and telling everyone how great psychedelics are. There are truths you will learn about yourself, but you shouldn’t take every vision as literal truth.

Your journaling can be creative, and nonlinear. Listen to your intuition about how you’ve shifted and what you sense to be true of yourself - perhaps something you’ve always felt and the psychedelic experience allowed you to accept or surface in a new way.

This takes time.

To help the process of change, start a new system for yourself - such as a healthier diet, more regular spiritual practice, a consistent exercise regimen. Getting yourself into new habits and casting out old ones can be a powerful method of integrating the truths you’ve witnessed in your journey.

But be aware also that returning to the ordinary world is an important part of the integration process. Ascension into the clouds without a way to resume life on this plane doesn’t do you or your community any good. And just like an astronaut shouldn’t be trying to convince every human that they need to go out to space, the psychonaut need not evangelize deep inner-space exploration. It’s only for the select few. You must come back to Earth. As Jack Kornfield writes, [“after the ecstasy, the laundry](https://jackkornfield.com/after-the-ecstasy-the-laundry/).”

Ultimately integration in the context of the psychedelic experience is a method for those with a proclivity to explore new dimensions of their minds to make fragmented parts of themselves whole. It can be a painful process to see fissures in your psyche that you’ve developed strong defenses around - those defenses are important survival strategies. Don’t take this work lightly.

This has been a guide to some of the fundamental lessons that I feel would have been valuable to me when first embarking on this path. I hope they’ve been useful to you. We’ll keep writing on these topics, sending out weekly news on what’s happening in the world of psychedelics and looking for new ways to engage with the psychonaut community.

Until next time, stay kind
