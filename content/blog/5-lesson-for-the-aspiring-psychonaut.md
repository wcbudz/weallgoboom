Lesson 1: The Dao of the Psychonaut

**_TL;DR for Lesson 1: Use alternative states of consciousness to start becoming aware of the patterns and streams that make up the mask of "you."_**

What do you feel, when you say the word I; I, myself? You might not think about it in normal conversation.

But when you dig into the chambers of your experience and try to surface it, you see it’s elusive at best.

Alan Watts said, “That’s why there’s always an element of profound mystery in the problem of who we are. Because what you are in your inmost being escapes your own examination in exactly the same way in that you can’t look into your own eyes without using a mirror, you can’t bite your own teeth, you can’t taste your own tongue and you can’t touch the tip of this finger with the tip of this finger.”

This is the problem the psychonaut tackles. A psychonaut is someone who is relentlessly focused on the search for a signal in the noise to show us who we really are.

The word psychonaut is from the Ancient Greek words psychē “soul, spirit, mind” and ναύτηςnaútēs “sailor, navigator” – “a sailor of the soul” and this is what we do - using tools of mind exploration we enter altered states that allow us to put a new lens on our minds and explore unknown landscapes.

Like Jim Carrey said, at some point in the psychonaut’s life they say, “I don’t care what it looks like, I found a hole in the psyche and I’m going through and I’m going to face the abyss of not knowing whether that’s going to be ok with everybody or not.”

There is no rulebook for how this exploration commences, no psychenomicon to catalog the monsters you may encounter in the abyss as these things are all unique to your particular combination of experiences and chemical makeup. What we hope to do in this guide is to give you an introduction to some of the lessons our experience has shown us to be useful heuristics for navigating the sea of the mind.

What we’ll talk about in this first installment is what we’ll call the Dao of the psychonaut.

In Daoism, we can think of Dao loosely translated as way or path, or most simply as Lao-tzu put it, “The Dao principle is what happens of itself.”

As psychonauts, we think of the Dao as the course, the flow, or the process of nature. It’s a “stateless state” that the psychonaut tries to direct their awareness to in their explorations. Being with the Dao is what lets us glimpse our true nature.

Verbal descriptions lose what we’re getting at here - the Dao cannot be defined in words, and it’s not really an idea that you can put in a box.

You can’t put the wind in a sack.

So what good does the Dao do us in our psychoanutical quests?

The principle is that if everything is allowed to go its own way the harmony of the universe will be established since every process in the world can “do its own thing” only in relation to all others.

In your explorations of your own consciousness, you’re going to work on letting go of the ego, our instrument for imposing its own sense of order on the world and ourselves and touch the place where you understand that everything’s own way is the way of the universe.

When you can do this you’ll have a glimpse of “who you are” and as Ram Dass said, “only when I know who I am, will I know what is possible.”

The difficulty in getting to that place where you can bear witness to the flow of things is that you have layers upon layers of psychological constructions in the way. Constructions that might keep you ‘safe’ as many of our apparatuses formed as defenses to a hostile, confusing or otherwise traumatic event in our childhood, but they block us from letting go and experiencing the stream of nature that carries us behind our machinations.

There are also constructions of our culture - in some way these keep these safe in a collective as well, but mostly, and Terence McKenna is a fantastic resource for this line of thinking, culture is a perversion of nature that drives us to false happiness and dehumanization and isolation from the Dao.

This is not easy work.

But what you’ll come to know with effort on the psychonaut’s path is that there are no good trips, there are no bad trips, that there are just trips. Putting that at the forefront when embarking on a journey is the first step towards keeping your vessel sailing towards the Dao.

**Lesson 2: Entheogens I've known and loved**

**_TL;DR for lesson 2: Any kind of altered state can be a doorway to self-exploration. Choose something that is safely procured, develop your path with that method, and branch out from there._**

Hello citizen, As a psychonaut, you'll be experimenting with altered states of consciousness in the interest of self-exploration and knowledge. To achieve those states a variety of methods are available, not all drug-induced. A pioneer of psychonautica, Stanislov Graf, developed a method of working with just your breath and music called [holtropic breathwork](http://www.holotropic.com/holotropic-breathwork/about-holotropic-breathwork/), which allows us to enter deep states of non-ordinary consciousness. This is one of but many methods of exploration, but personally, the preferred rocket fuel for propulsion towards the stars of our minds is plant-based entheogens. Entheogen, meaning a drug that facilitates seeing the "god within" is a word coined in the late 70s by a group of ethnobotanists and literary scholars, including R. Gordon Wasson, a man largely responsible for introducing America to psilocybin mushrooms in the late 50s.

Humans have been using entheogens for[ thousands of years in ceremony and religious practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogenic_drugs_and_the_archaeological_record). Today, because of loosening restrictions on these substances are being seen as valuable to the medical industry for healing and wellness. My hope is that we find a path to incorporating them into our culture without allowing capitalism to[ completely knock the teeth out ](https://weallgoboom.com/numinus-pitch-deck/)of these powerful teachers.

You can easily find [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_substances_used_in_rituals) of which plants contain entheogens and have been used by humans. One of the best places to start your research is in the incomparable catalog of human experience with psychoactive substances, [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/psychoactives.shtml).

Erowid is like having the notes of a world-wide team of research psychonauts at your fingertips. You'll find precise reports of how substances were obtained, what dosages were taken, hour by hour trip reports and detailed instructions on cultivating your own supply, from instructions for the advanced chemist to the hobbyist gardener.

If you're an initiate to the psychonaut calling, it can be intimidating to sit in front of this wealth of information and know where to start. My recommendation is to start wherever you are - let the Dao of the psychonaut float you towards what will work given your geolocation, resources and environmental variables.

Cannabis is an overlooked portal to the unexplored; common usage will have you stoned on a couch, passively watching someone else's story on Netflix and over-eating processed foods. But the psychonaut can ascend the mediocre and [glimpse the face of the infinite ](https://bodhitree.com/the-mystical-roots-of-cannabis/)using cannabis as a guide. Cannabis can be easy to procure in most cities and is increasingly legal or decriminalized throughout North America.

But, to truly storm the gates, there is a better option. Slightly less accessible for some, but worth the investment in obtaining a safe and reliable source if possible: psilocybe containing mushrooms.

This entire guide could focus solely on the mushroom, but there are so many expert references out there, I'll make it my role to recommend where to start.

If you don't have a supplier the choice can be made to grow your own. It's much simpler and less resource-intensive than growing cannabis, and growing a lifetime personal supply becomes absolutely simple once you have the fundamentals down.

There are many books and internet discussion on the various methods - we've been cultivating psilocybe at home since the late 1950s - the best place to start IMHO is discussions on [the Shroomery](https://www.shroomery.org/) Create an account there and start engaging with the community or just consuming the knowledge. You'll find a very engaged and welcoming populous - the sense of exploration and scientific investigation of the best methods and hacks to cultivating various species of mushrooms is stupendous.

My favorite method is a piece of tek (shorthand for 'technique') called monotub, developed by many, but in particular the efforts of user[ Mush Zombie](https://www.shroomology.org/forums/topic/46-how-to-grow-shrooms-in-bulk-monotubs/).

Although the fruiting bodies (the part that you recognize as a mushroom) are illegal, in most states in the US the mushroom spores are legal to possess and sell (sorry ID, CA and GA - the spores are also illegal in your state). There is an abundance of spore retailers online, but today my most trusted source is [Sporeworks.](http://sporeworks.com/) We may write a step by step guide from spore procurement to advanced techniques for developing your own liquid cultures in the future - please write in and let us know if this is something you'd be interested in. The final entheogen I'll mention, but more difficult than others to procure is DMT. N,N-Dimethyltryptamine is a naturally occurring chemical. It's in our own brains, it's in many plants, and some animals even produce it in their secretions. Smoking DMT can send you into a non-reality that rips the illusion of our day to day world away in a brilliant and terrifying fashion. It has been called the businessman's trip because of how short-acting it is, one could conceivably explore a new dimension listening to the chattering of machine-elves, and be completely grounded back in this reality in the time it takes for a short lunch break.

To use DMT properly you'll need a good psychonatical partner and we recommend some experience with psilocybin before jumping to this advanced technique. We'll also be writing an in-depth guide to this "spirit molecule" in the future.

In the next edition of this guide, we'll go through what is important to know in regards to the set and setting in the use of entheogens and even some retreats that have been established for safe exploration with knowledgeable guides.
