Hello citizen,

What do you feel, when you say the word I; I, myself? You might not think about it in normal conversation.

But when you dig into the chambers of your experience and try to surface it, you see it's elusive at best.

Alan Watts said, "That’s why there’s always an element of profound mystery in the problem of who we are. Because what you are in your inmost being escapes your own examination in exactly the same way in that you can’t look into your own eyes without using a mirror, you can’t bite your own teeth, you can’t taste your own tongue and you can’t touch the tip of this finger with the tip of this finger."

This is the problem the psychonaut tackles. A psychonaut is someone who is relentlessly focused on the search for a signal in the noise to show us who we really are.

The word psychonaut is from the Ancient Greek words psychē "soul, spirit, mind" and ναύτηςnaútēs "sailor, navigator" – "a sailor of the soul" and this is what we do - using tools of mind exploration we enter altered states that allow us to put a new lens on our minds and explore unknown landscapes.

Like Jim Carrey said, at some point in the psychonaut's life they say, “I don’t care what it looks like, I found a hole in the psyche and I’m going through and I’m going to face the abyss of not knowing whether that’s going to be ok with everybody or not."

There is no rulebook for how this exploration commences, no psychenomicon to catalog the monsters you may encounter in the abyss as these things are all unique to your particular combination of experiences and chemical makeup. What we hope to do in this guide is to give you an introduction to some of the lessons our experience has shown us to be useful heuristics for navigating the sea of the mind.

What we'll talk about in this first installment is what we'll call the Dao of the psychonaut.

In Daoism, we can think of Dao loosely translated as way or path, or most simply as Lao-tzu put it, "The Dao principle is what happens of itself."

As psychonauts, we think of the Dao as the course, the flow, or the process of nature. It's a "stateless state" that the psychonaut tries to direct their awareness to in their explorations. Being with the Dao is what lets us glimpse our true nature.

Verbal descriptions lose what we're getting at here - the Dao cannot be defined in words, and it's not really an idea that you can put in a box.

You can't put the wind in a sack.

So what good does the Dao do us in our psychoanutical quests?

The principle is that if everything is allowed to go its own way the harmony of the universe will be established since every process in the world can "do its own thing" only in relation to all others.

In your explorations of your own consciousness, you're going to work on letting go of the ego, our instrument for imposing its own sense of order on the world and ourselves and touch the place where you understand that everything's own way is the way of the universe.

When you can do this you'll have a glimpse of "who you are" and as Ram Dass said, "only when I know who I am, will I know what is possible."

The difficulty in getting to that place where you can bear witness to the flow of things is that you have layers upon layers of psychological constructions in the way. Constructions that might keep you 'safe' as many of our apparatuses formed as defenses to a hostile, confusing or otherwise traumatic event in our childhood, but they block us from letting go and experiencing the stream of nature that carries us behind our machinations.

There are also constructions of our culture - in some way these keep these safe in a collective as well, but mostly, and Terence McKenna is a fantastic resource for this line of thinking, culture is a perversion of nature that drives us to false happiness and dehumanization and isolation from the Dao.

This is not easy work.

But what you'll come to know with effort on the psychonaut's path is that there are no good trips, there are no bad trips, that there are just trips. Putting that at the forefront when embarking on a journey is the first step towards keeping your vessel sailing towards on the Dao.

Until next time, stay kind.
